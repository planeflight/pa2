If CSIL is used for performance assessment instead of Expanse, make sure you evaluate when such a machine is lightly 
loaded using “uptime”. Please  indicate your evaluation is done on CSIL and list the uptime index of that CSIL machine.

1. How is the code parallelized? Show your solution by listing the key computation parallelized with
  OpenMP and related code. 


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.  Report the parallel time, speedup, and efficiency with blocking mapping, block cyclic mapping with block size 1 
and block size 16 using  2 cores (2 threads), and 4 cores (4 threads) for parallelizing the code 
in handling a full dense matrix with n=4096 and t=1024.

3.  Report the parallel time, speedup, and efficiency with blocking mapping, block cyclic mapping with block size 1 
and block size 16 using  2 cores (2 threads), and 4 cores (4 threads) for parallelizing the code 
in handling an upper triangular matrix (n=4096 and t=1024).

Write a short explanation on why one mapping method is significantly faster than or similar to another.
